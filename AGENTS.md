# Agent Guidelines

- please do not eslint-disable, just fix the implementation
- Please use GitHub Flavored Markdown
- do not ignore eslint
- Never read secret env files during normal work. Do not open or inspect `.env*`, `.dev.vars`, `.prod.vars`, `.env.keys`, or other secret-bearing local config unless the user explicitly asks for that file/value.
- If env context is needed, use committed docs and `src/env.ts` to understand the schema, and ask the user to paste a non-secret subset instead of reading local secret files.

## Steering (Project Context)

Load `docs/` as project memory at session start or when context is needed.

- **Path**: `docs/`
- **Default files**: `PRODUCT.md`, `TECH.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`
- **Task memory**: `.agents/memory/todo.md`, `.agents/memory/lessons.md`
- **Other docs**: Add or manage as needed (domain-specific .md)

Use steering to align decisions with product goals, tech stack, and structure.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One tack per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction from the user: update `.agents/memory/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `.agents/memory/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `.agents/memory/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `.agents/memory/lessons.md` after corrections

## Video Verification Protocol

The reference video `docs/assets/PS2 Startup Screen.mp4` is the **single source of truth** for this project. All implementation must be verified against it.

### Rules

1. **Video-first**: When in doubt about any visual detail (color, timing, layout, motion), extract the relevant frame from the video and inspect it. Do NOT rely on memory or assumptions.
2. **Frame extraction**: Use `ffmpeg` to extract frames at specific timestamps for comparison.
   ```bash
   # Extract a frame at a specific second
   ffmpeg -ss <seconds> -i "docs/assets/PS2 Startup Screen.mp4" -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 /tmp/ps2-ref-<seconds>s.jpg
   ```
3. **Compare at checkpoints**: After implementing each phase (see `docs/STRUCTURE.md`), take a viewport screenshot and compare side-by-side with the corresponding video frame.
4. **Mandatory comparison points**:
   - `0.0s`: Initial top-down view — pillar density, camera angle
   - `1.0s`: Early rotation — pillar perspective, central glow visibility
   - `4.0s`: Mid scene — particle trails, floating cubes
   - `7.0s`: Pre-acceleration — zoom level, pillar scale
   - `8.5s`: Acceleration — motion blur feel, darkness progression
   - `9.5s`: Blackout — must be pure black
5. **If it doesn't match the video, it's wrong.** Adjust until it matches. The docs describe the video; if the docs and the video disagree, the video wins.

### Verification Workflow

```
Implement feature
  → Extract reference frame from video (ffmpeg)
  → Take viewport screenshot
  → Compare visually
  → If mismatch: identify delta → adjust → re-compare
  → If match: proceed to next feature
```

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code. YAGNI, KISS, DRY. No backward-compat shims or fallback paths unless they come free without adding cyclomatic complexity.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
- **Video Is Canon**: The reference video is the ultimate authority. If implementation looks different from the video, the implementation is wrong.
